hip - Hip Isn't a Player
A LGPLed mpeg audio decoding library.

*** This dorectory contained a modified version of mpg123, it is now
*** replaced by a proper interface in libmpg123. What remains is just
*** the interface for lame which then calls into libmpg123.

Based off of Michael Hipp's mpglib 0.2a <http://www.mpg123.de/>, with many
improvements by the lame development team (see AUTHORS).

The interface to the library is based off of vorbisfile.  If you add mp3
support to your app using this library it should be a snap to add Ogg Vorbis
support as well.

This isn't as fast as mpg123 will be for decoding as none of it is in
assmbler.  

Seeking currently isn't implemented.
