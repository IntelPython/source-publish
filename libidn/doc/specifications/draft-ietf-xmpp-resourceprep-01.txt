1. Introduction

   This document, which defines a profile of stringprep (RFC 3454 [1]),
   specifies processing rules that will enable users to enter
   internationalized resource identifiers in XMPP (see XMPP Core [2])
   and have the highest chance of getting the content of the strings
   correct.  These processing rules are intended for XMPP resource
   identifiers only, and not for arbitrary text.

   This profile defines the following, as required by RFC 3454 [1]:

   o  The intended applicability of the profile: internationalized
      resource identifiers within XMPP

   o  The character repertoire that is the input and output to
      stringprep: Unicode 3.2, specified in section 2

   o  The mappings used: specified in section 3

   o  The Unicode normalization used: specified in section 4

   o  The characters that are prohibited as output: specified in section
      5

   o  Bidirectional character handling: specified in section 6


1.1 Terminology

   This document inherits the terminology defined in XMPP Core [2].

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [3].

1.2 Discussion Venue

   The authors welcome discussion and comments related to the topics
   presented in this document.  The preferred forum is the
   <xmppwg@jabber.org> mailing list, for which archives and subscription
   information are available at <http://www.jabber.org/cgi-bin/mailman/
   listinfo/xmppwg/>.

1.3 Intellectual Property Notice

2. Character Repertoire

   This profile uses Unicode 3.2 with the list of unassigned code points
   being Table A.1, both defined in Appendix A of RFC 3454 [1].

   3454 [1]:

   described in RFC 3454 [1].

6. Bidirectional Characters

   This profile specifies checking bidirectional strings as described in
   section 6 of RFC 3454 [1].

7. Security Considerations

   The Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 repertoires have many characters that
   look similar.  In many cases, users of security protocols might do
   visual matching, such as when comparing the names of trusted third
   parties.  Because it is impossible to map similar-looking characters
   without a great deal of context such as knowing the fonts used,
   stringprep does nothing to map similar-looking characters together
   nor to prohibit some characters because they look like others.

   Resource identifiers are commonly employed as session names for users
   who connect to XMPP servers for instant messaging and presence
   services.  The usability of such services could be compromised if a
   user entering a single internationalized resource identifier could
   attempt to initiate multiple sessions with the same name based on
   different interpretations of the internationalized resource
   identifier; however, it is unlikely that such a confusion would
   compromise security.

8. IANA Considerations

   This is a profile of stringprep.  If and when it becomes an RFC, it
   should be registered in the stringprep profile registry maintained by
   the IANA [4].

   Name of this profile:

      Resourceprep

   RFC in which the profile is defined:

      This document

   Indicator whether or not this is the newest version of the profile:

      This is the first version of Resourceprep
