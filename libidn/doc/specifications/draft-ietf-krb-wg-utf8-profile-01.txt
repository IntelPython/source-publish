Abstract

This document describes how to prepare UTF-8 strings for use with Kerberos
protocols in order to increase the likelihood that name input and name comparison
work in ways that make sense for typical users throughout the world. This
is a profile of "Preparation of Internationalized Strings" [RFC3454]. 

1. Introduction

This document specifies processing rules that will allow users to enter
Kerberos Principal Names and input to cryptographic String to Key functions.
It is a profile of stringprep [RFC3454].

This profile defines the following, as required by [RFC3454]

- The intended applicability of the profile: internationalized
host name parts

- The character repertoire that is the input and output to stringprep:
defined in Section 2

- The list of unassigned code points for the repertoire: defined
in Appendix D.

- The mappings used: defined in Section 3.

- The Unicode normalization used: defined in Section 4

- The characters that are prohibited as output: Defined in section 5


1.2 Terminology

The key words "MUST", "SHALL", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", and
"MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
[RFC2119].

Examples in this document use the notation for code points and names
from the Unicode Standard [Unicode3.1] and ISO/IEC 10646 [ISO10646]. For
example, the letter "a" may be represented as either "U+0061" or "LATIN
SMALL LETTER A". In the lists of prohibited characters, the "U+" is left
off to make the lists easier to read. The comments for character ranges
are shown in square brackets (such as "[SYMBOLS]") and do not come from
the standards.


2. Character Repertoire

Unicode 3.2 [Unicode3.2] is the repertoire used in this profile.
The reason Unicode 3.2 was chosen instead of a version of
ISO/IEC 10646 is that Unicode 3.2 is the basis for [RFC3454].


3. Mapping

This profile specifies stringprep mapping using the mapping table
in Appendix C. That table includes all the steps described in this
section.

Note that text in this section describe how Appendix C was formed. It is
there for people who want to understand more, but it should be ignored
by implementors. Implementations of this profile MUST map based on
Appendix C, not based on the descriptions in this section of how
Appendix C was created.

3.1 Mapped to nothing

The following characters are simply deleted from the input (that is,
they are mapped to nothing) because their presence or absence should not
make two strings different.

Some characters are only useful in line-based text, and are otherwise
invisible and ignored.

00AD; SOFT HYPHEN
1806; MONGOLIAN TODO SOFT HYPHEN
200B; ZERO WIDTH SPACE
2060; WORD JOINER
FEFF; ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE

Variation selectors and cursive connectors select different glyphs, but
do not bear semantics.

034F; COMBINING GRAPHEME JOINER
180B; MONGOLIAN FREE VARIATION SELECTOR ONE
180C; MONGOLIAN FREE VARIATION SELECTOR TWO
180D; MONGOLIAN FREE VARIATION SELECTOR THREE
200C; ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER
200D; ZERO WIDTH JOINER
FE00; VARIATION SELECTOR-1
FE01; VARIATION SELECTOR-2
FE02; VARIATION SELECTOR-3
FE03; VARIATION SELECTOR-4
FE04; VARIATION SELECTOR-5
FE05; VARIATION SELECTOR-6
FE06; VARIATION SELECTOR-7
FE07; VARIATION SELECTOR-8
FE08; VARIATION SELECTOR-9
FE09; VARIATION SELECTOR-10
FE0A; VARIATION SELECTOR-11
FE0B; VARIATION SELECTOR-12
FE0C; VARIATION SELECTOR-13
FE0D; VARIATION SELECTOR-14
FE0E; VARIATION SELECTOR-15
FE0F; VARIATION SELECTOR-16

3.2 Space Character Conversions

Space characters can make accurate visual transcription of names
nearly impossible and could lead to user entry errors in many
ways.  The following Unicode spaces are to be mapped to 0020; SPACE:
 
0020; SPACE
00A0; NO-BREAK SPACE
1680; OGHAM SPACE MARK
2000; EN QUAD
2001; EM QUAD
2002; EN SPACE
2003; EM SPACE
2004; THREE-PER-EM SPACE
2005; FOUR-PER-EM SPACE
2006; SIX-PER-EM SPACE
2007; FIGURE SPACE
2008; PUNCTUATION SPACE
2009; THIN SPACE
200A; HAIR SPACE
202F; NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE
205F; MEDIUM MATHEMATICAL SPACE
3000; IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE

4. Normalization

This profile specifies using Unicode normalization form KC, as described
in [UAX15].

NOTE: There was some discussion on the mailing list that would suggest
that Unicode NFKC does not properly handle the composition of
normalized Hangul strings.  Following the lead of the IDN working
group, the Kerberos working group will not attempt to second-guess the
the authors of Unicode 3.1 Annex 15 (formerly Technical Report 15)
[UAX15], which specifies the normalization methods, or the Ideographic
Rappaorteur Group (IRG), which is the formal subgroup of ISO/IEC
JTC1/SC2/WG2 charged with approving all CJKV elements of the Unicode
standards.  Such issues are outside the working group's charter and
its area of expertise.

5. Prohibited Output

This profile specifies using the prohibition table in Appendix D.

Note that the subsections below describe how Appendix D was formed. They
are there for people who want to understand more, but they should be
ignored by implementors. Implementations of this profile MUST map based
on Appendix D, not based on the descriptions in this section of how
Appendix D was created.

The collected lists of prohibited code points can be found in Appendix D
of this document. The lists in Appendix D MUST be used by implementations
of this specification. If there are any discrepancies between the lists
in Appendix D and subsections below, the lists in Appendix D always takes
precedence.

Some code points listed in one section would also appear in other
sections. Each code point is only listed once in the tables in Appendix
D.


5.1 Control characters

Control characters (or characters with control function) cannot be seen
and can cause unpredictable results when displayed.

0000-001F; [CONTROL CHARACTERS]
007F; DELETE
0080-009F; [CONTROL CHARACTERS]
06DD; ARABIC END OF AYAH
070F; SYRIAC ABBREVIATION MARK
180E; MONGOLIAN VOWEL SEPARATOR
200C; ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER
200D; ZERO WIDTH JOINER
2028; LINE SEPARATOR
2029; PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR
2060; WORD JOINER
2061; FUNCTION APPLICATION
2062; INVISIBLE TIMES
2063; INVISIBLE SEPARATOR
206A-206F; [CONTROL CHARACTERS]
FEFF; ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE
FFF9-FFFC; [CONTROL CHARACTERS]
1D173-1D17A; [MUSICAL CONTROL CHARACTERS]

5.2 Private use and replacement characters

Because private-use characters do not have defined meanings, they are
prohibited. The private-use characters are:

E000-F8FF; [PRIVATE USE, PLANE 0]
F0000-FFFFD; [PRIVATE USE, PLANE 15]
100000-10FFFD; [PRIVATE USE, PLANE 16]

5.3 Non-character code points

Non-character code points are code points that have been allocated in
ISO/IEC 10646 but are not characters. Because they are already assigned,
they are guaranteed not to later change into characters.

FDD0-FDEF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]
FFFE-FFFF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]
1FFFE-1FFFF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]
2FFFE-2FFFF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]
3FFFE-3FFFF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]
4FFFE-4FFFF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]
5FFFE-5FFFF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]
6FFFE-6FFFF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]
7FFFE-7FFFF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]
8FFFE-8FFFF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]
9FFFE-9FFFF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]
AFFFE-AFFFF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]
BFFFE-BFFFF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]
CFFFE-CFFFF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]
DFFFE-DFFFF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]
EFFFE-EFFFF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]
FFFFE-FFFFF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]
10FFFE-10FFFF; [NONCHARACTER CODE POINTS]

The non-character code points are listed the PropList.txt file from the
Unicode database.

5.4 Surrogate codes

The following code points are permanently reserved for use as surrogate
code values in the UTF-16 encoding, will never be assigned to
characters, and are therefore prohibited:

D800-DFFF; [SURROGATE CODES]

5.5 Inappropriate for plain text

The following characters should not appear in regular text.

FFF9; INTERLINEAR ANNOTATION ANCHOR
FFFA; INTERLINEAR ANNOTATION SEPARATOR
FFFB; INTERLINEAR ANNOTATION TERMINATOR
FFFC; OBJECT REPLACEMENT CHARACTER

Although the replacement character (U+FFFD) might be used when a name is
displayed,  it doesn't make sense for it to be part of the name itself.
It is often displayed by renderers to indicate "there would be
some character here, but it cannot be rendered". For example, on a
computer with no Asian fonts, a name with three ideographs might be
rendered with three replacement characters.

FFFD; REPLACEMENT CHARACTER

5.6 Inappropriate for canonical representation

The ideographic description characters allow different sequences of
characters to be rendered the same way, which makes them inappropriate
for host names that must have a single canonical representation.

2FF0-2FFB; [IDEOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION CHARACTERS]

5.7 Change display properties

The following characters can cause changes in display or the order in
which characters appear when rendered, or are deprecated in Unicode.

0340; COMBINING GRAVE TONE MARK
0341; COMBINING ACUTE TONE MARK
200E; LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK
200F; RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK
202A; LEFT-TO-RIGHT EMBEDDING
202B; RIGHT-TO-LEFT EMBEDDING
202C; POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING
202D; LEFT-TO-RIGHT OVERRIDE
202E; RIGHT-TO-LEFT OVERRIDE
206A; INHIBIT SYMMETRIC SWAPPING
206B; ACTIVATE SYMMETRIC SWAPPING
206C; INHIBIT ARABIC FORM SHAPING
206D; ACTIVATE ARABIC FORM SHAPING
206E; NATIONAL DIGIT SHAPES
206F; NOMINAL DIGIT SHAPES

5.8 Tagging characters

The following characters are used for tagging text and are invisible.

E0001; LANGUAGE TAG
E0020-E007F; [TAGGING CHARACTERS]

6. Bidirectional Characters

This profile specifies checking bidirectional strings as described
in [RFC3454] section 6.


7. Unassigned Code Points

This profile lists the unassigned code points for Unicode 3.2 in
Appendix E. The list in Appendix E MUST be used by implementations of
this specification. If there are any discrepancies between the list in
Appendix E and the Unicode 3.2 specification, the list Appendix E always
takes precedence.


8. Security Considerations

ISO/IEC 10646 has many characters that look similar. In many cases,
users of security protocols might do visual matching, such as when
comparing the names of trusted third parties. This profile does nothing
to map similar-looking characters together.

Principal names and passwords are entered by users and used within the
Kerberos protocol. The
security of the Internet would be compromised if a user entering a
single internationalized string could be connected to different servers
or denied access based on different interpretations of 
internationalized strings.

9. IANA Considerations

IANA is to register this profile as described in [RFC3454].

C. Mapping Tables

The following is the mapping table from Section 3. The table has three
columns:
- the character that is mapped from
- the zero or more characters that it is mapped to
- the reason for the mapping
The columns are separated by semicolons. Note that the second column may
be empty, or it may have one character, or it may have more than one
character, with each character separated by a space.
