Abstract:
	Until now, many standards was issued to standardize creating and managing 
	IDN (Internationalized Domain Names), all those standards discussed the 
	technical problem issued from the need to keep the structure of the internet 
	that uses standard (ASCII) domain names untouched; using this pretext those 
	standards forced  some rules that make lingual grammars for some languages 
	not respected on the language domain names.

	This document will try to define a new type of domain names called the 
	"multilingual domain names" (MLDNs) , these names are supposed to respect 
	the grammatical and spelling of every language so at least, every language 
	can use the words of its own dictionary in its own domain names.
	The system supposed to manage the reservation and the resolution of the new 
	domain names (MLDNs) must also respect the infrastructure of the traditional 
	domain names system (DNS) untouched so it will not jeopardize the stability  
	of the internet.
	In the rest of the document we will refer to that system by MLDNS (Multi-
	Lingual Domain Names System).  

	MLDNS Will use the same large repertoire of Unicode characters to compose 
	its domain names and that means the use of none-ASCII characters, this use 
	must allow all languages to have their domain names that respect their 
	language properties and rules. Also it must depends on a technique that 
	keeps the stable DNS system untouched.

1. Introduction:
	Internationalized domain names (IDN) are still a subject of a great 
	debates between technical associations and organizations, each one 
	tries to create new standards that controls the new addressing mass 
	that will be launched by the new unlimited possibilities of non ASCII 
	domain names, all those standards agree on one major issue that is 
	keeping the current stable DNS system  unaffected by the new era of 
	using UNICODE domain names.

	Focusing on technical issues in all drafts and RFCs talking about IDN 
	imposed a lot of natural language usage limitations, and these 
	limitations prevent national languages from using all their characters 
	and all their vocabulary and their sentences structure in their 
	national domain names. And in some times those limitations force the 
	user to use domain names that does not satisfy the grammars of the 
	natural language.

	For example, the prevention of using space character in domain names 
	will force languages that contain joint characters (characters that  
	change their shapes according to their place in the word) to have un-
	readable domain names, the suggested solution is to use dashes to 
	separate between words consists of joinable characters and this is not 
	acceptable grammatically. like Chinese and Arabic languages as  RFC 
	3743 and internet draft "draft-bakleh-reg-adm-acg-apu-00.txt".


2. Problem Analysis:
	The problem mentioned in the introduction is caused by the fact that 
	IDN rule makers have prepared general studies to control the creation 
	of IDNs, such studies does not take in consideration the properties 
	and the specialties of each language and as a result we have 
	Internationalized domain name that does not satisfy the user needs of 
	having user friendly domain names which are familiar to his own 
	national language which is called multilingual domain name MLDN. 

	This can be clearly seen by the fact that we have a UNIQUE nameprep 
	proposed to test all the domain names in the world in all the 
	languages of the world nations, and this nameprep is recommended to be 
	the first layer to handle the domain name and decide wither it can be 
	used as an IDN or not. which isn∆t a technical need to keep the 
	current DNS stability and the network infrastructure untouched.
 

3. Introducing MLDN:
	The term MLDN stands for MultiLingual Domain Names, the only 
	difference between IDN and MLDN is that MLDN allows each language to 
	implement its own nameprep to test its own domain names, and it allows 
	each language to put syntactical rules of composing its own domain 
	names. And so it will be the sole  responsible of determining its 
	domain names method and nameprep method managing its reservation and 
	registration systems, but it is NOT allowed to each language to have 
	its own ACE (ACII Compatible Encoding) to represent its domain names.
  
      
4. ML Recommendations:
	MLDN must have several namepreps but a unique ACE to encode the 
	national domain name. based on these MLDNs recommendations:

	1.MLDNA must not use more than one lingual character set in  any part 
	  of MLDNs.

	2.The lingual nameprep must gives the possibility to use all 
	  language∆s words in the domain name system from both technical and 
	  grammatical point of view.
	
	3.MLDNA reservation must have the technical possibility to register 
	  any domain name agreed by its nameprep method.

	4.MLDN must give each nation a full control to determine its lingual 
	  nameprep and its elements (the UNICODE characters set and its 
	  (MLgTLDs) Multilingual generic Top Level domain names and its 
	  (MLccTLDs)  Multilingual country code Top Level Domain Names) to 
	  be the UNIQUE  choice to use in its domain names. The nation's 
	  control must be submitting by the accreditation of its official 
  	  countries through its ccTLDs authorities as the sole publisher 
	  through ICANN and IANA.

	5.MLDN must create  an smart ACE based on variant characters 
	  encoding according  its using rates to have  longer MLDNs more 
	  than the PUNYCODE gives.
                       
5. MLDNA:
	To realize this goal we have to take the previous RFCs talking about 
	IDN (Internationalized domain names) in consideration, specially RFC 
	3490 talking about IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names in 
	Application) this RFC offers a reasonable solution to realize non 
	ASCII domain names system based on the current DNS system.
        IDNA suggests that the following structure to realize IDN system.
        

                            +------+
                            | User |
                            +------+
                               ^
                               | Input and display: local interface methods
                               | (pen, keyboard, glowing phosphorus, ...)
           +-------------------|-------------------------------+
           |                   v                               |
           |          +-----------------------------+          |
           |          |        Application          |          |
           |          |   (ToASCII and ToUnicode    |          |
           |          |      operations may be      |          |
           |          |        called here)         |          |
           |          +-----------------------------+          |
           |                   ^        ^                      | End system
           |                   |        |                      |
           | Call to resolver: |        | Application-specific |
           |              ACE  |        | protocol:            |
           |                   v        | ACE unless the       |
           |           +----------+     | protocol is updated  |
           |           | Resolver |     | to handle other      |
           |           +----------+     | encodings            |
           |                 ^          |                      |
           +-----------------|----------|----------------------+
               DNS protocol: |          |
                         ACE |          |
                             v          v
                  +-------------+    +---------------------+
                  | DNS servers |    | Application servers |
                  +-------------+    +---------------------+
        
   This structure gives the possibility to realize what we have already 
   called MLDN, according to this RFC each IDN system will have its 
   toASCII function or layer that grantees the conversion of UNICODE 
   domain names into standard domain name. the main obstacle in IDNA that 
   prevents the realization of MLDN is the existence of the UNIQUE 
   nameprep in the toASCII layer. 

   So the idea of MLDNA is to use the IDNA structure but to let each 
   language build its own nameprep and us it in the toASCII layer. 
   Allowing the national language users to build its nameprep will permit 
   them to put linguistic rules to control the creation of the languages 
   national domain names according to its grammatical and orthographical 
   rules. And this will guarantee the creation of user friendly MLDNs 
   with the full respect to both internet current  infrastructure and 
   national languages needs.
