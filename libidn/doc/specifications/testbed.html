<h1 align=center>IDNConnect testbed</h1>

If you are a developer of IDNA-aware software or services, you may
want to test them at your own site against the testbed created
for the IDNConnect event (described
<a href="http://idnconnect.jdna.jp/">here</a>). If you are
<i>not</i> a developer, these tests will probably mean nothing
to you; they cannot be used by end users who do not control
both a name server and an Apache web server.

<p>
The set of tests is available by downloading
<a href="IDNConnect-testbed.tgz">IDNConnect-testbed.tgz</a>.
Instructions for loading the testbed are in the INSTRUCTIONS.txt file.
