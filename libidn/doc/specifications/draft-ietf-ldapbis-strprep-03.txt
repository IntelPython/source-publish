Abstract

  The previous Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) technical
  specifications did not precisely define how character string matching
  is to be performed.  This led to a number of usability and
  interoperability problems.  This document defines string preparation
  algorithms for character-based matching rules defined for use in LDAP.

Conventions

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

  Character names in this document use the notation for code points and
  names from the Unicode Standard [Unicode].  For example, the letter
  "a" may be represented as either <U+0061> or <LATIN SMALL LETTER A>.
  In the lists of mappings and the prohibited characters, the "U+" is
  left off to make the lists easier to read.  The comments for character
  ranges are shown in square brackets (such as "[CONTROL CHARACTERS]")
  and do not come from the standard.

  Note: a glossary of terms used in Unicode can be found in [Glossary].
  Information on the Unicode character encoding model can be found in
  [CharModel].


1. Introduction

1.1. Background

  A Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [Roadmap] matching rule
  [Syntaxes] defines an algorithm for determining whether a presented
  value matches an attribute value in accordance with the criteria
  defined for the rule.  The proposition may be evaluated to True,
  False, or Undefined.

      True      - the attribute contains a matching value,

      False     - the attribute contains no matching value,

      Undefined - it cannot be determined whether the attribute contains
                  a matching value or not.

  For instance, the caseIgnoreMatch matching rule may be used to compare
  whether the commonName attribute contains a particular value without
  regard for case and insignificant spaces.


1.2. X.500 String Matching Rules

  "X.520: Selected attribute types" [X.520] provides (amongst other
  things) value syntaxes and matching rules for comparing values
  commonly used in the Directory.  These specifications are inadequate
  for strings composed of Unicode [Unicode] characters.

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-ldapbis-strprep-03     15 February 2004


  The caseIgnoreMatch matching rule [X.520], for example, is simply
  defined as being a case insensitive comparison where insignificant
  spaces are ignored.  For printableString, there is only one space
  character and case mapping is bijective, hence this definition is
  sufficient.  However, for Unicode string types such as
  universalString, this is not sufficient.  For example, a case
  insensitive matching implementation which folded lower case characters
  to upper case would yield different different results than an
  implementation which used upper case to lower case folding.  Or one
  implementation may view space as referring to only SPACE (U+0020), a
  second implementation may view any character with the space separator
  (Zs) property as a space, and another implementation may view any
  character with the whitespace (WS) category as a space.

  The lack of precise specification for character string matching has
  led to significant interoperability problems.  When used in
  certificate chain validation, security vulnerabilities can arise.  To
  address these problems, this document defines precise algorithms for
  preparing character strings for matching.


1.3. Relationship to "stringprep"

  The character string preparation algorithms described in this document
  are based upon the "stringprep" approach [StringPrep].  In
  "stringprep", presented and stored values are first prepared for
  comparison and so that a character-by-character comparison yields the
  "correct" result.

  The approach used here is a refinement of the "stringprep"
  [StringPrep] approach.  Each algorithm involves two additional
  preparation steps.

  a) prior to applying the Unicode string preparation steps outlined in
     "stringprep", the string is transcoded to Unicode;

  b) after applying the Unicode string preparation steps outlined in
     "stringprep", characters insignificant to the matching rules are
     removed.

  Hence, preparation of character strings for X.500 matching involves
  the following steps:

      1) Transcode
      2) Map
      3) Normalize
      4) Prohibit
      5) Check Bidi (Bidirectional)

      6) Insignificant Character Removal

  These steps are described in Section 2.


1.4. Relationship to the LDAP Technical Specification

  This document is a integral part of the LDAP technical specification
  [Roadmap] which obsoletes the previously defined LDAP technical
  specification [RFC3377] in its entirety.

  This document details new LDAP internationalized character string
  preparation algorithms used by [Syntaxes] and possible other technical
  specifications defining LDAP syntaxes and/or matching rules.


1.5. Relationship to X.500

  LDAP is defined [Roadmap] in X.500 terms as an X.500 access mechanism.
  As such, there is a strong desire for alignment between LDAP and X.500
  syntax and semantics.  The character string preparation algorithms
  described in this document are based upon "Internationalized String
  Matching Rules for X.500" [XMATCH] proposal to ITU/ISO Joint Study
  Group 2.


2. String Preparation

  The following six-step process SHALL be applied to each presented and
  attribute value in preparation for character string matching rule
  evaluation.

      1) Transcode
      2) Map
      3) Normalize
      4) Prohibit
      5) Check bidi
      6) Insignificant Character Removal

  Failure in any step causes the assertion to evaluate to Undefined.

  This process is intended to act upon non-empty character strings.  If
  the string to prepare is empty, this process is not applied and the
  assertion is evaluated to Undefined.

  The character repertoire of this process is Unicode 3.2 [Unicode].

2.1. Transcode

  Each non-Unicode string value is transcoded to Unicode.

  TeletexString [X.680][T.61] values are transcoded to Unicode as
  described in Appendix A.

  PrintableString [X.680] value are transcoded directly to Unicode.

  UniversalString, UTF8String, and bmpString [X.680] values need not be
  transcoded as they are Unicode-based strings (in the case of
  bmpString, a subset of Unicode).

  The output is the transcoded string.


2.2. Map

  SOFT HYPHEN (U+00AD) and MONGOLIAN TODO SOFT HYPHEN (U+1806) code
  points are mapped to nothing.  COMBINING GRAPHEME JOINER (U+034F) and
  VARIATION SELECTORs (U+180B-180D,FF00-FE0F) code points are also
  mapped to nothing.  The OBJECT REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (U+FFFC) is
  mapped to nothing.

  CHARACTER TABULATION (U+0009), LINE FEED (LF) (U+000A), LINE
  TABULATION (U+000B), FORM FEED (FF) (U+000C), CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)
  (U+000D), and NEXT LINE (NEL) (U+0085) are mapped to SPACE (U+0020).

  All other control code points (e.g., Cc) or code points with a control
  function (e.g., Cf) are mapped to nothing.

  ZERO WIDTH SPACE (U+200B) is mapped to nothing.  All other code points
  with Separator (space, line, or paragraph) property (e.g, Zs, Zl, or
  Zp) are mapped to SPACE (U+0020).

  Appendix B provides a table detailing the above mappings.

  For case ignore, numeric, and stored prefix string matching rules,
  characters are case folded per B.2 of [StringPrep].

  The output is the mapped string.


2.3. Normalize

  The input string is be normalized to Unicode Form KC (compatibility
  composed) as described in [UAX15].  The output is the normalized
  string.

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-ldapbis-strprep-03     15 February 2004


2.4. Prohibit

  All Unassigned code points are prohibited.  Unassigned code points are
  listed in Table A.1 of [StringPrep].

  Characters which, per Section 5.8 of [Stringprep], change display
  properties or are deprecated are prohibited.  These characters are are
  listed in Table C.8 of [StringPrep].

  Private Use (U+E000-F8FF, F0000-FFFFD, 100000-10FFFD) code points are
  prohibited.

  All non-character code points (U+FDD0-FDEF, FFFE-FFFF, 1FFFE-1FFFF,
  2FFFE-2FFFF, 3FFFE-3FFFF, 4FFFE-4FFFF, 5FFFE-5FFFF, 6FFFE-6FFFF,
  7FFFE-7FFFF, 8FFFE-8FFFF, 9FFFE-9FFFF, AFFFE-AFFFF, BFFFE-BFFFF,
  CFFFE-CFFFF, DFFFE-DFFFF, EFFFE-EFFFF, FFFFE-FFFFF, 10FFFE-10FFFF) are
  prohibited.

  Surrogate codes (U+D800-DFFFF) are prohibited.

  The REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (U+FFFD) code point is prohibited.

  The step fails if the input string contains any prohibited code point.
  Otherwise, the output is the input string.


2.5. Check bidi

  This step fails if the input string does not conform to the the
  bidirectional character restrictions detailed in 6 of [Stringprep].
  Otherwise, the output is the input string.


2.6. Insignificant Character Removal

  In this step, characters insignificant to the matching rule are to be
  removed.  The characters to be removed differ from matching rule to
  matching rule.

  Section 2.6.1 applies to case ignore and exact string matching.
  Section 2.6.2 applies to numericString matching.
  Section 2.6.3 applies to telephoneNumber matching.


2.6.1. Insignificant Space Removal

  For the purposes of this section, a space is defined to be the SPACE
  (U+0020) code point followed by no combining marks.



Zeilenga                        LDAPprep                        [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-ldapbis-strprep-03     15 February 2004


  NOTE - The previous steps ensure that the string cannot contain any
         code points in the separator class, other than SPACE (U+0020).

  If the input string consists entirely of spaces or is empty, the
  output is a string consisting of exactly one space (e.g. " ").

  Otherwise, the following spaces are removed:
    - leading spaces (i.e. those preceding the first character that is
      not a space);
    - trailing spaces (i.e. those following the last character that is
      not a space);
    - multiple consecutive spaces (these are taken as equivalent to a
      single space character).

  For example, removal of spaces from the Form KC string:
      "<SPACE><SPACE>foo<SPACE><SPACE>bar<SPACE><SPACE>"
  would result in the output string:
      "foo<SPACE>bar"
  and the Form KC string:
      "<SPACE><SPACE><SPACE>"
  would result in the output string:
      "<SPACE>".


2.6.2. numericString Insignificant Character Removal

  For the purposes of this section, a space is defined to be the SPACE
  (U+0020) code point followed by no combining marks.

  All spaces are regarded as not significant.  If the input string
  consists entirely of spaces or is empty, the output is a string
  consisting of exactly one space (e.g. " ").  Otherwise, all spaces are
  to be removed.

  For example, removal of spaces from the Form KC string:
      "<SPACE><SPACE>123<SPACE><SPACE>456<SPACE><SPACE>"
  would result in the output string:
      "123456"
  and the Form KC string:
      "<SPACE><SPACE><SPACE>"
  would result in the output string:
      "<SPACE>".


2.6.3. telephoneNumber Insignificant Character Removal

  For the purposes of this section, a hyphen is defined to be
  HYPHEN-MINUS (U+002D), ARMENIAN HYPHEN (U+058A), HYPHEN (U+2010),



Zeilenga                        LDAPprep                        [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-ldapbis-strprep-03     15 February 2004


  NON-BREAKING HYPHEN (U+2011), MINUS SIGN (U+2212), SMALL HYPHEN-MINUS
  (U+FE63), or FULLWIDTH HYPHEN-MINUS (U+FF0D) code point followed by no
  combining marks and a space is defined to be the SPACE (U+0020) code
  point followed by no combining marks.

  All hyphens and spaces are considered insignificant.  If the string
  contains only spaces and hyphens or is empty, then the output is a
  string consisting of one space.  Otherwise, all hyphens and spaces are
  removed.

  For example, removal of hyphens and spaces from the Form KC string:
      "<SPACE><HYPHEN>123<SPACE><SPACE>456<SPACE><HYPHEN>"
  would result in the output string:
      "123456"
  and the Form KC string:
      "<HYPHEN><HYPHEN><HYPHEN>"
  would result in the output string:
      "<SPACE>".

Appendix A. Teletex (T.61) to Unicode

  This appendix defines an algorithm for transcoding [T.61] characters
  to [Unicode] characters for use in string preparation for LDAP
  matching rules.  This appendix is normative.

  The transcoding algorithm is derived from the T.61-8bit definition
  provided in [RFC1345].  With a few exceptions, the T.61 character
  codes from x00 to x7f are equivalent to the corresponding [Unicode]
  code points, and their values are left unchanged by this algorithm.
  E.g. the T.61 code x20 is identical to (U+0020).  The exceptions are
  for these T.61 codes that are undefined: x23, x24, x5c, x5e, x60, x7b,
  x7d, and x7e.

  The codes from x80 to x9f are also equivalent to the corresponding
  Unicode code points.  This is specified for completeness only, as
  these codes are control characters, and will be mapped to nothing in
  the LDAP String Preparation Mapping step.



Zeilenga                        LDAPprep                       [Page 10]

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-ldapbis-strprep-03     15 February 2004


  The remaining T.61 codes are mapped below in Table A.1.  Table
  positions marked "??" are undefined.

  Input strings containing undefined T.61 codes SHALL produce an
  Undefined matching result. For diagnostic purposes, this algorithm
  does not fail for undefined input codes.  Instead, undefined codes in
  the input are mapped to the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (U+FFFD).
  As the LDAP String Preparation Prohibit step disallows the REPLACEMENT
  CHARACTER from appearing in its output, this transcoding yields the
  desired effect.

  Note: RFC 1345 listed the non-spacing accent codepoints as residing in
        the range starting at (U+E000).  In the current Unicode
        standard, the (U+E000) range is reserved for Private Use, and
        the non-spacing accents are in the range starting at (U+0300).
        The tables here use the (U+0300) range for these accents.

            Table A.1:  Mapping of 8-bit T.61 codes to Unicode

  T.61 also defines a number of accented characters that are formed by
  combining an accent prefix followed by a base character.  These
  prefixes are in the code range xc1 to xcf. If a prefix character
  appears at the end of a string, the result is undefined.  Otherwise
  these sequences are mapped to Unicode by substituting the
  corresponding non-spacing accent code (as listed in Table A.1) for the
