        Abstract 
         
        There have been several attempts aimed at developing an Arabic Domain Name 
        System using Arabic characters in an Arabic-language coherent fashion. To 
        satisfy this demand, an entire environment needs to be developed in order to 
        take into account technology standardization, policy and administrative 
        arrangements, as well as new applications. In the beginning of the second 
        quarter of 2003, an Arabic Domain Name Task Force (ADNTF) was formed under the 
        auspices of United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia 
        (ESCWA), and the guidance of Multilingual Internet Names Consortium (MINC); one 
        of its main objectives was to help define standards for ADNS through a Request 
        For Comments (RFC) document. This document resolves many technical and 
        linguistic issues, including the adoption of the client-side DNS-based approach 
        to name resolution; syntax of the proposed Arabic Domain Names together with the 
        character set and many Arabic language-specific issues were clearly resolved. 
        This Internet-Draft proposes guidelines that are compatible with the Internet 
        Consortium for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the Internet Engineering 
        Task Force (IETF) as far as Domain Names System (DNS) and Internationalized 
        Domain Names (IDN) standards are concerned. Technical, management, operational, 
        and language-specific issues are discussed and recommendations are made.

        1. INTRODUCTION 
         
        The Arab region suffers from a digital divide that is mostly manifested in the 
        form of the lowest regional Internet usage rate in the world. Language is 
        identified to be one of the main barriers to widespread Internet usage. Along 
        with the attempts to increase the volume of Arabic content on the Internet, 
        there have been also several attempts aiming at the Arabization of Domain Names 
        themselves. These attempts, when completely successful, will create the thrust 
        for a second wave of Internet spread across the Arab region. The future of 
        Arabic Internet names is imminent; there is substantial market and user demand 
        for Arabic Domain Names. To satisfy this demand, the entire environment will 
        need to be developed to take into account technology standardization, policy and 
        administrative arrangements, as well as new applications. The significance of 
        these efforts should not be underestimated, as it is part of a far nobler goal: 
        the ongoing internationalization of the Internet. 
         
        The IDN Standards issued by the IETF solve the generic domain name access issue 
        for scripts beyond the limitation of the existing ASCII character set. Localized 
        implementations are to be drawn from this set of standards. This draft provides 
        specific guidelines for the use of Arabic language and provides a foundation for 
        other documents encompassing languages that use similar scripts (e.g. Urdu, 
        Farsi). The ADNTF will cooperate with experts from the Urdu and Farsi speaking 
        Internet community in order to cover these languages and address other 
        organizational and policy issues in an interoperable manner. 
         
        2. EVOLUTION OF ARABIC DOMAIN NAMES 
         
        The efforts exerted so far to define an Arabic Domain Name System (ADNS) were 
        not done in isolation of the world; they were carried out within the context of 
        the global movement towards Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) and 
        Multilingual Domain Names (MLDNs). Most of these IDNs or MLDNs were also 
        developed within a wider framework of the Domain Name System (DNS). 
         
        In the conventional DNS, one has to differentiate between three types of 
        players: (a) organizations, (b) technology providers, and (c) service providers: 
        namely Registries/Registrars. Each of those three types of players is 
        responsible for a different set of goals and normally undertakes a special set 
        of activities.  
         
        The context of Arabic Domain Names 
         
        2.1 Dynamics of the Previous Phase 
         
        2.1.1. Global Evolution 
         
        During the previous five years, the evolution of MLDNs was not easy. While the 
        Internet Consortium for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was evolving, it was 
        naturally preoccupied with reorganization issues related to the entities 
        responsible for coordinating the development of the conventional Internet. It 
        was this preoccupation that left room for uncoordinated efforts and the 
        emergence of competing standards for the ADNS creating a state of uncertainty. 
         
        MDLN activities and efforts were started in Eastern Asia, by Korean, Chinese and 
        Japanese languages much earlier than the Arabic language; where a multitude of 
        technology providers, registries, and registrars emerged.  
         
        Technologies differ amongst different providers mainly in terms of the manner in 
        which they use the client-server relationship, in addition to the differences in 
        the character-set and the language script itself. 
         
        Domain Name Systems and Languages 
         
        2.1.2. Regional Evolution 
         
        During this early period, implementations of the ADNS varied enormously amongst 
        technology providers and their respective registries. Those technology providers 
        competed feverishly in order to impose standards upon the community, and to 
        create a status quo that they could use to reinforce their position and also to 
        gain profits to sustain their innovation cycle.  
         
        The battle created a chaotic situation and standardization was not achieved;  
         
        Registries were technology-centric, and took the risk of adhering to standards 
        and/or technologies that may become obsolete in a very short term. This 
        consequently risked the sustainability of the Domain Names of their end-users. 
        Further to this, the uniqueness of an Arabic Domain Name on the Internet is 
        currently not guaranteed; so two entities/persons can register the same name on 
        two different registries!  
         
        On the other side, many registries refused to implement any solution before it 
        is adopted by an independent authority; consequently, most of the technology 
        providers couldn't secure enough clients. Some of them went out of business due 
        to the chaotic situation. 
         
        It was hoped that the Arab Internet Names Consortium (AINC) would assume the 
        role of the coordinating body. Unfortunately, it couldn't due to internal 
        conflicts. The absence of a strong regional coordinating body prevented 
        development in this area. At the start of the year 2003, the situation could be 
        summarized as follows: 
         
        -Professionals and consumers lacked awareness of the viability and importance of 
        Arabic Domain Names in general; 
         
         
        -Time and effort was wasted on competing technologies and standards put a drain 
        on the resources of emerging ADNS companies;  
         
        -The absence of a coordinating body reduced overall effectiveness and hampered 
        efforts to move forward towards a regulated environment. 
         
        It remains to say that the past period resulted in an accumulation of experience 
        amongst the involved players. This experience will be an asset that will 
        facilitate the next phase of the ADNS evolution. 
         
        2.2. Milestones 
         
        The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) issued in March 2003 a set of RFCs 
        for Internationalized Domain Names [4, 5, 6] and (Appendix 2) - that are 
        supposed to become the de facto standard for all languages. From then on, the 
        battle for standards had been, to a large extent, resolved. New and emerging 
        technology providers will no longer need to compete on the basic standards but 
        rather on efficiency levels and the cost of the technology. All registries and 
        registrars will be compatible and most importantly, the domain names themselves 
        will be unique as they should be.  
         
        In the beginning of April 2003, the United Nations Economic and Social 
        Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) became involved in the revitalization of 
        Arab regional efforts by calling for an Expert Group Meeting to be held in early 
        June. On 11 June 2003, the Multilingual Internet Naming Consortium (MINC) 
        announced its policies on linguistic and cultural relevance [12]. In April 2004, 
        the Joint Engineering Team (JET) produced an RFC 3743 [10] on IDN registration 
        and administration for Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages. 
         
        2.3. Revitalization of the Arab Regional Efforts 
         
        The aforementioned Expert Group Meeting at UN House in Beirut from 3 to 5 June, 
        2003 intended to establish a new roadmap for development of the Arabic Domain 
        Name industry and discussed activities required to establish consensus on the 
        ADNS. Considering the potential and impact of the ADNS, this meeting was 
        intended to identify obstacles and set objectives and initiatives for the 
        promotion of the ADNS in a coordinated fashion. 
         
        Upon the recommendations of the participants, an Arabic Domain Name Task Force 
        (ADNTF) was formed under the auspices of ESCWA, which also acted as its 
        secretariat. The following objectives were agreed upon: 
         
        -Raising awareness among stakeholders about the importance of the Arabic Domain 
        Names System (ADNS); 
         
        -Defining standards for ADNS through a Request For Comments (RFC) document; 
         
        -Promoting the adoption of standards in a coordinated fashion; 
         
        -Obtaining global recognition for the adopted standards; 
         
        -Facilitating the deployment of these standards by the various stakeholders. 
         
        In preparing this Internet-Draft, three members of the ADNTF (namely Mr. Abdel-
        Ati, Mr. Al-Zoman, and Mr. El-Sherbiny) were given responsibility for drafting 
        the document. Mr. El-Sherbiny acted as focal point/coordinator, discussing 
        various issues with ADNTF members, compiling contributions and structuring the 
        document. 
         
        The current phase is concerned with defining a set of agreeable and consistent 
        standards for ADNS, which are compatible with existing domain naming standards.  
        Producing this set of standards is a necessity in the process of streamlining 
        the efforts of the region in the same direction. 
         
         
        3. ARABIC LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC ISSUES 
         
        The main objective of the creation of an ADNS is to have a vehicle to increase 
        Internet use amongst all strata of the Arabic-speaking communities. If the 
        structure or hierarchy of the ADNS does not meet certain core criteria, then the 
        intended wide-scale dissemination of the Internet would be hampered.  
         
        Furthermore, a non-user friendly ADNS would further add to the ambiguity and the 
        eccentricity of the Internet to the Arabic-speaking communities, thus 
        contributing negatively to the spread of the Internet and leading to further 
        isolation of these communities at the global level.  
         
        Hence, there have been intensive efforts especially those spearheaded by Dr. Al-
        Zoman and recently contributed to by ESCWA to reach some consensus on a 
        multitude of linguistic issues with the following goals: 
         
        -To define the accepted Arabic character set to be used for writing domain names 
        in Arabic; 
         
        -To define the top-level domains of the Arabic domain name tree structure (i.e., 
        Arabic gTLDs and ccTLDs). 
         
        As indicated in the studies carried out by Dr. Al-Zoman [7] and [8], there are 
        many valid criteria to evaluate the proposed Arabic generic top-level domains 
        gTLDs, or the Arabic country code top-level domains ccTLDs namely: 
         
        (a) Length of the generic Top-Level Domain (gTLD) or the Country Code Top-Level 
        Domain (ccTLD); 
         
         (b) Coherence and clarity; 
         
        (c) Consistency with the Arabic language; 
         
         (d) Ease of pronunciation; 
         
         (e) Extendibility. 
         
        (f) The name as a whole (x.y.z) can be easily guessable, by being as close as 
        possible to the real-world name; 
         
        (g) The name as a whole (x.y.z) is acceptable to the native Arabic-speaker's 
        ear, i.e. user friendly. 
         
        The last two items are necessary in order to achieve wide-scale dissemination. 
        They are of utmost importance in the deployment and take-up of ADNS. 
         
        3.1. Linguistic Issues 
         
        There are a number of linguistic issues that have been proposed with respect to 
        the usage of the Arabic language in domain names. This section will highlight 
        some of them. This section is extracted from the paper of Dr Al-Zoman [7]. For 
        details the reader is encouraged review the reference. 
         
        3.1.1. Tashkeel (Diacritics) 
         
        With respect to domain names, al-tashkeel can be supported only in the user 
        interface but should not be stored in the zone file. Therefore, it can be 
        stripped off at the preparation of internationalized strings (stringprep) phase. 
         
        3.1.2. Kasheeda or Tatweel (Horizontal Character Size Extension) 
         
        With respect to domain names, Kasheeda should not be used in Arabic domain 
        names. 
         
        3.1.3. Character folding 
         
        Character folding is the process where multiple letters (that may have some 
        similarity with respect to their shapes) are folded into one shape. This 
        includes: 
         
            -Folding Teh Marbuta and Heh at the end of a word; 
         
            -Folding different forms of Hamzah; 
         
            -Folding Alef Maksura and Yeh at the end of a word; 
         
            -Folding Waw with Hamzah and Waw. 
         
        With respect to the Arabic language, character folding is not always acceptable 
        because it changes the meaning of the words and it is against the simplest 
        spelling rules. Replacing a character with another character, which may have the 
        same shape but different pronunciation, will give a different meaning. This will 
        lead to have only one form (word) out many other forms of words that are made by 
        all the combination of folded characters. Hence, the other forms will be masked 
        by the common form. [7] 
         
        "It is often that because of laziness or weakness in spelling, handwriting mixes 
        between different characters (e.g., Heh and Teh-Marbuta). However, this is not 
        the case in published and printed materials. One of the motivations to support 
        the Arabic language in domain names is to preserve the language particularly 
        with the spread of the globalization movement. Hence, character folding is 
        working against this motivation since it is going to have a negative affect on 
        the principle and ethics of the language. Therefore, we should let the 
        technology works for the language and not the other way. Character folding 
        should not be allowed."[7] 
         
        3.2. Supported Character Set 
         
        It is recommended to use only the following UNICODE characters. These are based 
        on the study and the report from the Arabic linguistic committee of AINC based 
        on UNICODE version 3.1

        3.3. Arabic Domain Name Structure 
         
        A domain name consists of multiple words (codes) that are separated by dots. 
        Based on research, rationale, and reference to [7], after considering and 
        weighing a multitude of alternatives and combinations and after eliminating of 
        many possible combinations, the following structure is proposed for an Arabic 
        Domain Name based on the conclusion that the geographical classification is 
        adopted and there is no more activity classification corresponding to (.com), 
        (.org), etc. 
         
        The proposed structure has the following syntax (to be read from right to left) 
         
        <A-TLD>.<entity-name> 
         
        Where, <entity-name> represents the Arabic name of the entity and <A-TLD> 
        represents an Arabic TLD. UNICODE values in hexadecimal form are written below 
        from left to right representing Arabic characters originally typed from right to 
        left. 
         
        Example 1:  
        u+0634 u+0631 u+0643 u+0629 u+02D u+0627 u+0644 u+0632 u+0648 u+0645 u+0627 
        u+0646 u+002E u+0633 u+0639 u+0648 u+062F u+064A u+0629 
         
        Example 2: 
        u+0634 u+0631 u+0643 u+0629 u+02D u+0623 u+0631 u+0627 u+0645 u+0643 u+0648 
        u+002E u+0633 u+0639 u+0648 u+062F u+064A u+0629 
         
        Example 3: 
        u+0627 u+0644 u+0645 u+0631 u+0643 u+0632 u+02D u+0627 u+0644 u+062A u+062C 
        u+0627 u+0631 u+064A u+002E u+0633 u+0648 u+0631 u+064A u+0629 
         
        Example 4: 
        u+0627 u+062A u+062D u+0627 u+062F u+02D u+0643 u+0631 u+0629 u+02D u+0627 
        u+0644 u+0637 u+0627 u+0626 u+0631 u+0629 u+002E u+0639 u+0631 u+0628 u+064A 
         
        Example 5: 
        u+062C u+0627 u+0645 u+0639 u+0629 u+02D u+0627 u+0644 u+062E u+0631 u+0637 
        u+0648 u+0645 u+002E u+0633 u+0648 u+062F u+0627 u+0646 
         
        One of the features of this structure is switching the order of reading and 
        writing the category identifier to be at the beginning and to be part of the 
        name. The rationale behind the sequence is that in the Arabic language, it is 
        more proper not to use the company.com structure, but rather use com-company 
        instead.  
         
        3.4. Recommended Arabic gTLDs and ccTLDs 
         
        Based on [7], precisely, the currently-suggested Arabic gTLDs which use the 
        entity type for the classification are not suitable for the Arabic language. 
        Therefore, with respect to Arabic gTLDs, it is suggested to use the geographical 
        classification, using geographical descriptive words such as (u+062F u+0648 
        u+0644 u+064A) and (....)(u+0639 u+0631 u+0628 u+064A). These can be later 
        expanded to include other activities such as educational or commercial. 
         
        3.5. Arabic Linguistic Issues Affected By Technical Constraints 
         
        In this section the technical aspect of some linguistic issues as well as TLD 
        mapping is discussed 
         
        3.5.1. Numerals 
         
        According to Dr. Al-Zoman [7], in the Arab world, there are two sets of 
        numerical digits used  
         
        -Set I: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), mostly used in the western part of the 
        Arab world. 
         
        -Set II: (u+0660, u+0661, u+0662, u+0663, u+0664, u+0665, u+0666, u+0667, 
        u+0668, u+0669) mostly used in the eastern part of the Arab world. 
         
        Although visual differentiation between the Arabic zero (0) (u+0660) and the dot 
        (.)(u+002E) in printed material is possible (the zero is larger in size and is 
        printed higher than the dot), using it in domain names may lead to confusion. 
        Folding set II to set I will eliminate the problem of the zero, in specific, and 
        that of numerals in general. 
         
        The recommendation is that both sets should be supported in the user interface 
        and that both are folded to one set (Set I) at the preparation of 
        internationalized strings (e.g., "stringprep") phase.  
         
        3.5.2. The Space Character 
         
        The space character is strictly not allowed in domain names, as it is a control 
        character. Instead, the hyphen is proposed as a separator between Arabic words: 
        confusion can take place if the words are typed without a separator, unlike in 
        ASCII.  
         
        3.5.3 TLD mapping and ccTLD 
         
        Previous efforts have gone a great way towards establishing and implementing 
        country-specific Arabic ccTLD names. Several alternatives underwent a long 
        discussion process. 
         
        There are two choices for this representation [9]. The first is based on a full 
        word representation, while the second is based on a two-character coded 
        abbreviation table [11]. The full word option also involves the use, or lack 
        thereof, of the Arabic noun identification letter (Al-Altareef) (.                                                              .) (u+0627 
        u+0644) depending on the country. 
         
        Some of the two letter abbreviations carry inappropriate meanings; still, short 
        names represent a high degree of practicality. Long names, on the other hand, 
        can be used within advertising material for clearer name representation.  
         
        A TLD mapping process will allow a set of valid substitutions to be made, 
        including those previously used by older implementations. This mapping will 
        facilitate migration paths for existing systems. Users will be able to type 
        domain names in one of the following formats: 
         
        -long ccTLD name without Al-Altareef 
         
        -long ccTLD name with Al-Altareef where applicable (see table below) 
         
        -short two letter coded abbreviation  
         
        The table below shows the ccTLD codes for the Arab countries in the full word 
        form and the two letter abbreviation form. This table is adopted from A. Al-
        Zoman, "Supporting the Arabic Language in Domain Names", October 2003.

        To ensure a smooth and stable operational environment, further research must be 
        undertaken on both the root server management and the client IDN standards 
        implementation. 
         
        4. THE SOLUTION CONCEPT 
         
        4.1. DNS-Based Solution 
         
        Historically, there have been different approaches to the ADNS problem. 
        Solutions fell under one of two categories, namely DNS solutions and Keyword 
        solutions. "Keywords" are not domain names. Rather, they exist as an additional 
        layer above the DNS. Therefore, whilst DNS-based solutions only require the use 
        of the Internet's DNS resolution infrastructure, keyword-based solutions also 
        require a "URL Forwarding" technique to map simple references/names/phrases to 
        domain names or IP addresses. 
         
        As a pre-requisite to using "keywords", each resolvable domain name is 
        registered in a keyword-based directory in addition to the DNS registry. The 
        keyword directory is searched during the "look up" process, and matches in the 
        keyword registry are used to locate a particular URL or a list of matching sites 
        under that particular keyword.  On the other hand, DNS-based solutions are IETF 
        compliant, they do preserve the language integrity and they also allow 
        hyperlinks.  
         
        Keyword approaches are viable only as a supplemental scheme over and above a 
        robust DNS based solution, but they do not replace them. It is therefore 
        recommended not to use a keyword-based solution, but rather to employ a DNS-
        based solution to preserve the integrity of the Arabic language, to eliminate 
        any confusion and to become fully interoperable with existing DNS schemes [1, 2, 
        3]. The realm of RFC 3743 from the JET adopts a similar solution for Chinese, 
        Japanese, and Korean languages. [10] 
         
        4.2. Client-Side Approach 
         
        Generally, there are two schemes for resolving MDNs: server-based and client-
        based. 
         
        The proposed architecture for an ADNS is in accordance with the IETF standard 
        for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) [4, 5, 6] which recommends that a 
        client-side resolution scheme accommodate non-Latin languages like Arabic. This 
        is a layer above the current Internet structure. 
         
        5. FUTURE OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
         
        It is important to describe the operational aspects of ADNS in order to provide 
        ccTLD owners with a set of guidelines and policies for operation. JET has made a 
        similar effort in RFC 3743 published in April 2004 [10]. 
         
        These issues cannot be discussed in detail within the scope of this document. 
        Further efforts should be directed to enrich the operational aspects listed 
        below: 
         
        5.1 Registrar-Related Aspects 
         
        Existing IETF documents describe registry-management methods, and registrars 
        often develop applications to build DNS records based on data collected from 
        domain owners within the guidelines of the adopted policies. 
         
        A regional regulatory authority should appoint either (a) a single entity or 
        multiple entities working in coordination to maintain a registry of Arabic 
        Domain Names. On the country-specific level, ccTLDs will be managed 
        independently in each country by the country-appointed Network Administrator. In 
        as far as ccTLDs are concerned; each country will run its own Arabic ccTLD along 
        with the standard ASCII ccTLD. The regional regulatory authority will also be in 
        charge of approving the Arabic representation of ccTLD names of non-Arab 
        countries requesting such representation. 
         
        A good commercial model would be to follow the ICANN model where there are 
        accredited registrars that can appoint resellers at a premium. That way the 
        strong technically-qualified companies would act as registrars and a wide 
        reseller network can be established. 
         
        5.2 The Network Structure and Related Components 
         
        The proposed architecture for ADNS is based on a client-side resolution scheme, 
        which is a layer above the current Internet structure. On the client side, 
        workstations will be running some DNS resolution agent service at system level. 
        So when the local agent receives a DNS resolution request from upper-level 
        applications, it will take over the duty to talk to DNS servers configured for 
        the workstation. When the agent receives responses from DNS server, it will pass 
        back the results to upper-level applications.  
         
        Regarding IDN resolution, a software client intercepts the resolution request 
        before it reaches local resolution agent, and replaces the multilingual query 
        with ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) formatted value, in this case PUNNYCODE. So 
        for local resolution agent, it just follows the normal DNS resolution process 
        just as it does for ASCII formatted queries.  
         
        As an example, in order to resolve the domain name (u+0628 u+0631 u+064A u+062F 
        u+002E u+0634 u+0631 u+0643 u+0629 u+02D u+0627 u+0644 u+0648 u+0631 u+062F 
        u+002E u+0639 u+0631 u+0628 u+064A) the process would be as follows: 
         
        Step 1: the client converts the domain name to PUNNYCODE and sends a query 
        containing the domain name to the local name server. 
         
        Step 2: the local name server may not have the information about the domain 
        name, so it sends the query to one of the root servers. 
         
        Step 3: the root server cannot match the entire name, so it returns the best 
        match, i.e. the NS (name resolution) record for (u+0634 u+0631 u+0643 u+0629 
        u+02D u+0627 u+0644 u+0648 u+0631 u+062F u+002E u+0639 u+0631 u+0628 u+0649). It 
        also returns all records that are related to this record. 
         
        Step 4: the local name server sends the same query to the authoritative name 
        server for the mail zone (u+06E u+073 u+0031 u+002E u+0628 u+0631 u+064A u+062F 
        u+002E u+0634 u+0631 u+0643 u+0629 u+02D u+0627 u+0644 u+0648 u+0631 u+062F 
        u+002E u+0639 u+0631 u+0628 u+0649). 
         
        Step 5: the server has information about the domain and returns the answer: IP 
        address = 192.12.69.60 
         
        Step 6: the local name server then responds to the client with the IP value, the 
        client can then establish a TCP connection to the destination.  
         
        6. CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND OPEN ISSUES 
         
        6.1. Conclusions 
         
        The proposed guidelines are in full accordance with the IETF IDN standards and 
        take into account some Arabic language-specific issues as recommended by ICANN 
        and by Dr. Al-Zoman's research. This is to ensure that an Arabic-language 
        Internet, where access to Digital Arabic content is limited to some isolated 
        portion of cyberspace, is never created.  
         
        As for linguistic issues, it is a compromise between grammatical rules of the 
        Arabic language and the ease of use of the language on the Internet. 
         
        The proposed ADNS system is fully compatible with ICANN and IETF 
        recommendations. It is a client-side solution to transform the Arabic UNICODE 
        characters into an ASCII string that can operate in full compatibility with the 
        existing Internet protocols and structure. In this way, the creation of an 
        isolated Arabic intranet is avoided. Arabic Domain Names will be transformed to 
        PUNNYCODE representation at the client machine using a plug-in, the client would 
        then communicate with the local name server using ASCII strings (which is the 
        current standard of operation). 
         
        It is also proposed to go for TLD mapping for ccTLDs and gTLDs. It is also 
        recommended to use the hyphen as a word separator and to use both Arabic numbers 
        and Indian numbers to solve the zero and dot confusion problem.  
         
        6.2. Recommendations 
         
        It is time for the Arabic language to be widely disseminated on the Internet. 
        With the number of Arabic Internet users in excess of 5 million and increasing 
        exponentially, it is estimated that the quick implementation of the 
        recommendations of this document, will open a market in excess of 500,000 domain 
        names making this estimate based on the fact that the number of domains in 
        existence in the Western world is 10% of the number of Internet users. Domain 
        names and email addresses are key catalysts to the start of the Arabic Internet 
        industry. Added to this, all the industries that will emerge like Web hosting, 
        search engines and e-commerce will benefit from the development of an ADNS. 
         
        6.3. Open Issues 
         
        Stakeholders need to coordinate their efforts and collectively form a recognized 
        regional regulatory authority. This authority will be entrusted to appoint a 
        single entity, or alternatively set sufficient policy guidelines for multiple 
        entities, to operate a worldwide registry of approved Arabic gTLDs. Such a 
        scheme would be in line with the recommendations of RFC 3743 pertaining to zone 
        administration.  
         
        The issue of trademarks and registration policies should also be identified by 
        the regional regulatory authority along with legal experts. A list of forbidden 
        or banned domain names must be identified to protect political or religious 
        names; these alongside other political and ethical considerations will have to 
        be examined further. 
         
        Migration issues still need to be considered; as per the linguistic 
        recommendations. It is recommended to remove the equivalent of the .com gTLD all 
        together and stick to (.international) (u+062F u+0648 u+0644 u+064A) and 
        (.arabic) (u+0639 u+0631 u+0628 u+064A). However, in order not to disrupt the 
        service to the current end-users who have been using the (.shareka) )( (u+0634 
        u+0631 u+0643 u+0629) and/or (.sheen) ( (u+0634) for a number of years, such a 
        replacement proposal must only be carried out after a thoughtful and coordinated 
        linguistic and technical strategy for seamless migration has been agreed upon by 
        all stakeholders. Such a strategy could in principle include elements of TLD 
        mapping, which was previously described. 
         
        A broader collaboration is needed before all languages using the same script 
        (e.g. Urdu, Farsi) can fully adopt a unified approach to domain name resolution. 
        This work has to be done within the framework of existing standards in order to 
        produce a coherent solution that serves all the languages, maintaining their 
        individuality while providing a vehicle for better integration with the 
        connected world.

        IDN Standards Update 
         
        * IDN-related Requests for Comment (RFCs) published.  
         
        The Domain Name System (DNS) only recognizes ASCII characters A-Z, 0-9 and '-'. 
        This limits the number of characters that can be utilized to build domain names 
        to 37 of the more than 40,000 characters identified within Unicode. To create 
        domain names from the wider range of Unicode characters, a character-encoding 
        scheme that uniquely maps Unicode code points to an ASCII representation must be 
        used and standardized. 
         
        The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has led the effort in standardizing 
        the way that non-ASCII characters are to be represented within and handled by 
        DNS. The IETF published three standards related to Internationalized Domain 
        Names (IDN): 
         
            * Encoding scheme for IDNs  
            * Name preparation  
            * IDNs in applications  
         
        Encoding Scheme 
         
        The encoding scheme for IDNs will be an ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) that 
        will encode the local language characters of an IDN into ASCII characters such 
        that DNS can accurately answer a request for an address record. There are 
        several types of ACE. In order to select an ACE as the standard, IETF must 
        consider the difficult balance between compression and implementation. The 
        preferred ACE will allow the greatest number of characters (code points) to be 
        represented and will not be difficult to deploy. The VeriSign IDN Test bed 
        leverages an ACE known as Row-based ASCII Compatible Encoding (RACE). At the 
        time of the opening of the Test bed, RACE was a leading candidate to become the 
        standard. Today, another ACE known as Punycode is the leading candidate. Now 
        that the standard has been published, Test bed is migrating to that standard. 
         
        Name Preparation 
         
        The name preparation standard will provide the rules that will ensure uniqueness 
        in registering Unicode code points. The rules outline the criteria through which 
        a set of non-ASCII characters will be refined to ensure that there is no 
        ambiguity within the registrations of a specific name space. These rules are 
        Mapping, Normalization and Prohibition. 
         
        * Mapping:  Characters may be mapped to nothing, a single character or multiple 
        characters based upon their usefulness in text only or case. An example of 
        usefulness: the soft hyphen (u+00AD) is discretionary and only has use within 
        text and is invisible or ignored. The more common example is the mapping of a 
        capital letter to a small letter such as 'B' (u+0042) to 'b' (u+0062). This is 
        to ensure that a registration such as ibm.com does not have a conflict with 
        other registration such as IBM.com or iBm.com. 
         
        * There are cases where a single character will map to multiple characters. The 
        small letter sharp s or ' ' (u+00DF) has an upper case representation of 'SS' 
        (u+0053, u+0053). This is also the same upper case representation for 'ss' 
        (u+0073, u+0073). Therefore, ' ' maps to 'ss'. 
        * Normalization:  Once a set of characters has been mapped, the set is 
        normalized. Some input method editors (IME) enter characters that look exactly 
        like another character, but have different code points. For example, 1 is a 
        fullwidth digit one (u+FF11) and will normalize into a digit one (1) (u+0031). 
        Normalization also ensures predictable results through ordering where characters 
        have a number of combining diacritics. 
         
        * Prohibition:  After normalization, the mapped and normalized set of characters 
        is checked against a table of prohibited characters. These characters are 
        prohibited for a variety of reasons but the most common are spaces that could 
        lead to confusion and control characters that cannot be displayed. 
         
        IDNs in Applications 
         
        The IDN in applications standard focuses on the location where the Unicode to 
        ASCII mapping will take place. IETF's approach makes the applications that send 
        and receive traffic from DNS (browsers, e-mail clients, etc.) encode and decode 
        the Unicode characters. 
         
        The Bottom Line 
         
        All of these issues are currently outlined in the IETF Internet draft entitled 
        Preparation of Internationalized Host Names. The VeriSign IDN Testbed is 
        following this draft and will change as this draft is updated. 
         
        In summary, enhancing the current DNS to include more than just English 
        characters is not a simple undertaking. There are quite a few open issues 
        surrounding the deployment and use of IDNs that need to be resolved by the IETF. 
         
        Character variants 
         
        The majority of domain name registrants register domain names that have meaning 
        for them in their language - the domain name may be a name, word or phrase. 
        These words or phrases have meaning in the registrant's language. Yet, the 
        domain name may have different meanings in the context of other languages or 
        cultures. 
         
        The domain name registration process was designed without consideration of 
        language context. Technically speaking, the registrant registers a domain name 
        using a set of characters within a script. Since scripts may be used by more 
        than one language, the domain name is not registered in a specific language - it 
        is registered in a specific script or combination of scripts. For example, the 
        Latin script is used by many languages including English, French and German. A 
        domain name registered using the Latin script could have meaning for several 
        languages. 
         
        The overlap between scripts and languages define the variant issue. The 
        Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) in Applications (IDNA) protocol enables the 
        translation of all Unicode code points into unique ASCII strings. This broader 
        range of characters has the potential to cause end-user confusion due to 
        characters with similar appearances or interpretations, also known as variants. 
        To reduce confusion and improve the end-user experience, it is necessary to 
        address the variant issue. 
         
        While there are different types of variants, character variants are not covered 
        by the recently released IDN-related Requests for Comment (RFCs) as local 
        scripts and languages drive them. Communities throughout the world, especially 
        in Asia-Pacific, have asked Top-Level Domain (TLD) registries to address 
        character variant issues in their domain spaces to ensure a positive end-user 
        experience. Implementing its character variant solution helps improve the end-
        user experience. 
         
        Appendix 3: IETF and ICANN Recommendations 
        Source: http://www.icann.org/riodejaneiro/idn-topic.htm#5 
         
        IETF is a large open international community of network designers, operators, 
        vendors, and researchers concerned with the evolution of the Internet 
        architecture and the smooth operation of the Internet.  It is open to any 
        interested individual. 
         
        Actual technical work is done in Working Group organized by topics in several 
        areas. 
         
        As mentioned above, a standard has come out of the IETF and recommended by 
        ICANN. 
         
        Standards for ICANN Authorization of Internationalized Domain Name Registrations 
        in Registries with Agreements http://www.icann.org/riodejaneiro/idn-topic.htm#5: 
         
        At the same time, the premise of this paper is that it would be a mistake for 
        ICANN to pursue a burdensome and/or intrusive approach to IDN implementation" 
        for example, by putting ICANN in the position of approving a character-
        equivalence table for each language, and of maintaining such tables. The 
        deployment of IDNA within existing top-level domain registries is fundamentally 
        a registry responsibility, and the registries will be in the best position to 
        make appropriate implementation decisions themselves, and should have the 
        freedom to make adjustments as experience dictates. Just as DNS registries 
        embrace a wide diversity in registration policies and administrative procedures, 
        reflecting the diversity of local Internet communities, it seems apparent that 
        the vast diversity of human character sets and the languages from which they 
        come compels a language-by-language, registry-led approach to the development of 
        detailed registration policies and administrative procedures.
