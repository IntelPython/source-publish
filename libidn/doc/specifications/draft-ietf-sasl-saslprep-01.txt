Abstract

  This document describes how to prepare Unicode strings representing
  user names and passwords for comparison.  The document defines the
  "SASLprep" "stringprep" profile to be used for both user names and
  passwords.  This profile is intended to be used by Simple
  Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanisms (such as PLAIN,
  CRAM-MD5, and DIGEST-MD5) as well as other protocols exchanging user

  names and/or passwords.


1. Introduction

  The use of simple user names and passwords in authentication and
  authorization is pervasive on the Internet.  To increase the
  likelyhood that user name and password input and comparsion work in
  ways that make sense for typical users throughout the world, this
  document defines rules for preparing internationalized user names and
  passwords for comparison.  For simplicity and implementation ease, a
  single algorithm is defined for both user names and passwords.

  This document defines the "SASLprep" profile of the "stringprep"
  protocol [StringPrep].

  The profile is designed for use in Simple Authentication and Security
  Layer ([SASL]) mechanisms such as [PLAIN].  It may be applicable
  elsewhere simple user names and passwords are used.  This profile is
  not intended to be used for arbitrary text.  This profile is also not
  intended to be used to prepare identity strings which are not simple
  user names (e.g., e-mail addresses, domain names, distinguished
  names).


1.1. Conventions

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

  Character names in this document use the notation for code points and
  names from the Unicode Standard [Unicode].  For example, the letter
  "a" may be represented as either <U+0061> or <LATIN SMALL LETTER A>.
  In the lists of mappings and the prohibited characters, the "U+" is
  left off to make the lists easier to read.  The comments for character
  ranges are shown in square brackets (such as "[CONTROL CHARACTERS]")
  and do not come from the standard.

  Note: a glossary of terms used in Unicode can be found in [Glossary].
  Information on the Unicode character encoding model can be found in
  [CharModel].


2. The SASLprep profile

  This section defines the "SASLprep" profile.  This profile is intended
  to be used to prepare strings representing simple user names and

  passwords.

  This profile uses Unicode 3.2, as defined in [StringPrep, A.1].


2.1. Mapping

  This profile specifies:
    - non-ASCII space characters [StringPrep, C.1.2] be mapped to SPACE
      (U+0020), and

    - the "commonly mapped to nothing" characters [StringPrep, B.1] be
      mapped to nothing.



2.2. Normalization

  This profile specifies using Unicode normalization form KC, as
  described in Section 4 of [StringPrep].


2.3. Prohibited Output

  This profile specifies the following characters:

    - Non-ASCII space characters [StringPrep, C.1.2],
    - ASCII control charcters [StringPrep, C.2.1],
    - Non-ASCII control characters [StringPrep, C.2.2],
    - Private Use [StringPrep, C.3],
    - Non-character code points [StringPrep, C.4],
    - Surrogate code points [StringPrep, C.5],
    - Inappropriate for plain text [StringPrep, C.6],
    - Inappropriate for canonical representation [StringPrep, C.7],
    - Change display properties or are deprecated [StringPrep, C.8], and
    - Tagging characters [StringPrep, C.9].

  are prohibited output.


2.4. Bidirectional characters

  This profile specifies checking bidirectional strings as described in
  [StringPrep, Section 6].


2.5. Unassigned Code Points

  This profile specifies [StringPrep, A.1] table as its list of
  unassigned code points.


3. IANA Considerations

  This document details the "SASLprep" profile of [StringPrep] protocol.
  Upon Standards Action the profile should be registered in the
  stringprep profile registry.

      Name of this profile: SASLprep
      RFC in which the profile is defined: This RFC
      Indicator whether or not this is the newest version of the
      profile: This is the first version of the User Name profile.
