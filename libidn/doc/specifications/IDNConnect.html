Interoperability testing for internationalized domain names
<br>September 23 - 27, 2003</big></b></p>

<p>
Welcome to the site for IDNConnect. The
online event greatly enhanced the usefulness of internationalized
domain names by testing software that uses the IDNA protocols.

<h2>Final report of the event</h2>

<p>
The IDNConnect workshop, held online during the fourth week of September
2003, was attended by eight organizations from all over the world
representing a wide variety of internationalized Internet software. The
workshop succeeded in primary goals of improving the interoperability of
IDNA-enabled software, and proving that the IDNA specification is ready to
move forwards on standards track in the IETF.

<p>
The testbed used in the IDNConnect event consisted of over 120 tests of
using international characters in domain names. Participants in IDNConnect
tested web browsers and plug-ins, mail clients, zone editing programs, and
programming toolkits that will be used by other developers who want to use
the IDNA standard (RFCs 3490, 3491, and 3492) in their own software.

<p>
While some interoperability events are used to show how well individual
packages work with a standard, IDNConnect's primary focus was to help
developers see where their software did and did not yet conform to the IDNA
standard. Almost all participants said that the event help them find bugs in
their software, although most of those bugs were in the "edge cases" of the
standard that few typical users would possibly experience. All those
participants also said that the event allowed them to fix their software
during the event so they could verify that the bugs were fixed.

<p>
Part of the IETF standards process is to validate that a specification has
multiple interoperable implementations that are derived from different
sources. The fact that many IDNConnect participants could show that they
fully complied with the standard by the end of the event will help in a
report that will be prepared for the IETF in order to move the RFCs from
Proposed Standard to Draft Standard.

<p>
IDNConnect was sponsored and paid for
by JDNA, the Japanese Domain Names Association. The
JDNA promotes the active deployment of Japanese domain names in Japan and
throughout the world. JDNA's support of IDNConnect meant that there were no
registration fees for the participating organizations.

<p>
Further, JDNA has announced that it is making
<a href="testbed.html">the tests from the event's testbed</a> freely
available from the IDNConnect web site to developers of
IDNA-aware software. This will allow
all developers of internationalized software, whether or not they
participated in the IDNConnect event, to test their software against the
suite that was used during IDNConnect. The tests will be maintained and
added to in the future based on input from the wider Internet community.
As part of the development of the testbed, JDNA sponsored
the creation of a complete <a href="Description.txt">set of
interoperability tests for the entire IDNA specification</a>.
