INTERNET DRAFT		IDN-REG-ADM-ACG-APU	 september, 8, 2004



Abstract:
   This document provides guidelines for zone administrators(including 
   but not limited to registry operators and registrars), and
   information for all domain names holders, on the administration of
   those domain names which contain characters drawn from Arabic
   Characters Group of Languages. Other language groups are encouraged
   to develop their own guidelines as needed, based on these guidelines
   if that is helpful.

   The document gives basic guidelines for IDN registrars (as it 
   is the case for IETF Document that talks about Japanese, Chinese 
   and Korean domain name registration "RFC 3490"). The document 
   provides also information for owners of IDN that contains Arabic 
   characters on name reservation process. The document does not cover 
   Arabic gTLD or ccTLD problems.

   Comments on this document can be sent to the authors at

INTERNET DRAFT		IDN-REG-ADM-ACG-APU	 september, 8, 2004



0. Pre-Note for ASCII-version of this document

   In order to make meanings clear, especially in examples used 
   to clarify some ideas, such examples will be written using their 
   Unicode representation according to Unicode Standard 3.0.


1. Introduction:

   Introducing domain names as addresses on the internet added a 
   new vision to the Internet, it made internet addresses easy to 
   remember, and meaningful more than using sequences of numbers that 
   does not mean any thing to their user. Nowadays Internet users are 
   looking forward to surf on the net using more meaningful names in 
   their own language. Such names are called Internationalized Domain 
   Names (IDNs). This demand opened a wide field of research and ideas 
   as wide as the diversity of languages used by the people on the 
   earth. Each of these languages has its own writing and reading 
   rules. This fact threatens the integrity and the stability of 
   Internet, unless we invent a good solution that respects and 
   controls this mixture of rules and cultures and represents it with 
   a unique, robust and easy-to-use way.


2. Specialty of Arabic Characters Group of Languages:

   Arabic language is the official language of 22 countries; it is 
   also used by more than 43 Islamic countries that use Arabic 
   characters and scripts. In other words more than one billion 
   potential users could be interested in Arabic Domain Names. The 
   Arabic language as well as all Arabic Characters Group of Languages 
   (Persian, Urdu, Pashto, ..) has many specialties that have to be 
   considered when specifying any solution for Arabic Domain Names. 
   The main specialties of these languages are summed up in the 
   following:

	1.2. Scripts are written from right to left.

	2.2. The shapes of the character change in most cases according
	to its location in the word.

	2.3. Characters within the word are mostly conjugated with 
	preceding and succeeding characters.

	2.4. Some characters does not conjugate with following character.

INTERNET DRAFT		IDN-REG-ADM-ACG-APU	 september, 8, 2004



	2.5. The structure of the sentence starts from the most general to 
	the more specific (the opposite of the English language) 
	(Internet draft) in Arabic is said:( draft {of} Internet).


	2.6. Special characters called Tashkeel are used in order to give 
	the right pronunciation for the word which affects the meaning.
	In other words tashkeel can give one word two or More different
	meanings. Tashkeel is not a seprate character by itself, 
	but it modifies a normal Arabic character to give it the right
        pronuciation It has to be noted here that word meaning is mostly
	known from the context of the sentence or even the phrase in which
	the word is used. For Internet names these special signs have to
	be included but their application in the Internet Domain Names
	could be delayed for the time being.

	2-7. Correct words are written in a unique way, but the character 
	shaddah (U+0651); which falls under the tashkeel signs and 
	means doubling the letter associated with it; sometimes is 
	implicit in the word and sometimes is written. In these two 
	cases the same word; with or without shaddah; has (often) the 
	same meaning; but in some cases shaddah can change the 
	meaning of the word. So to decide considering or ignoring 
	such character an algorithm has to implemented.

	2.8. Correct orthographical practices about Hamza associated with 
	or without Alef and Yeh have to be followed. The same applies 
	to Yeh, Heh and Teh Marbuta.


3. Arabic Domain Names Recommendations: 

   3.1. Arabic domain names must allow the use of (SPACE) 
   character. This condition is vital, as Arabic characters (as cited 
   above) can be conjugated with each other and have different shapes 
   depending on their position in the word. If we do not allow the 
   space, words that form the ADL will be misread and misunderstood by 
   the users. The use of dash character (-) to separate words is NOT 
   acceptable according to IDNA (RFC-3490) which prevents the use of 
   characters that belong to another language when reserving a name 
   for a certain language, besides the fact that this character is not 
   used in Arabic, giving an odd view of the domain name.

INTERNET DRAFT		IDN-REG-ADM-ACG-APU	 september, 8, 2004



   3.2. Solving the issue that results form shaddah could be done 
   by an algorithm that generates all possible synonyms that results 
   from the implicit existence of shaddah. Grammatical rules that 
   controls the implicit existence of shaddah do exist. Such procedure 
   will prevent registering the same word that contains shaddah more 
   than once according to the existence or the absence of this 
   implicit shaddah by different individuals. Explicit shaddah which 
   does not come from grammatical rules have to be treated as a 
   character, so the registration system have to consider the 
   existence or the absence of this shaddah as a differentiator 
   between different domain names.
      
   3.3. Tashkeel Embodiment [Shadda (U+0651), Fatha (U+064E), Damma 
   (U+064F), Kasra (U+0650) and Superscript Aleph (U+0670)] must be 
   taken in the accredited character table, as it will give the 
   possibility to register one name more than once by using these 
   tashkeel characters with some or all alphabetical characters of a 
   certain name (there are 8 possible usage of tashkeel characters 
   that can be used with every other character). In spite of the need 
   to use these characters for correct Arabic Domain Names, we can 
   postpone using these five characters for future use. So tashkeel 
   characters have to be added to the accepted character set of Arabic 
   Domain Names but they have to be ignored currently in the 
   registration system. Meanwhile registration systems have to equate 
   Alef Maksura (U+0649) with Yeh (U+064A) in their processing 
   preventing registering more than one domain name based on these two 
   characters.
      
   3.4. Future standards for Arabic Domain Names have to abide to 
   the specificity of the Arabic characters group of languages, which 
   is also valid for all other language groups. A special attention is 
   drawn to (RFC 3490) which does not allow mixing characters from any 
   group of languages with characters belonging to another group.
      
   The above recommendations are valid for Persian, Pashto and Urdu 
   and other languages which use Arabic Characters.

4. Basics of searching for Arabic Domain Names:

   Name variants must be considered when searching an ADL, if any 
   name in an ADL package is the subject of a name resolving query, a 
   positive answer is to be given if the package was reserved (except 
   when using one of that common abbreviations). The resolving system 
   on the client side must not ignore tashkeel for future 
   developments, and it should abide to the rules dealing with 
   shaddah.


5. Ways of saving an Arabic Domain Name:

   5.1. Reservation of an ADL:

	As it is mentioned above, similarity cases (Name variants) must 
	be considered when reserving an Arabic domain name, all names 
	resulting from the similarity cases must be reserved, this will 
	prevent reserving different Arabic names that actually indicates 
	the same content by different persons. We can use the following 
	steps when reserving an Arabic domain name:

	IN = IDL to be registered
	if Is Valid(IN)  then
	Begin
	   For each Name in [Names variants of (IN)] do
	     If Is Valid (Name) Then
		 Reserve Name
	     End If
	   End For
	End If

	Where ŸIs Valid÷ as some algorithm that verifies if that the name 
	is compliant with the ADLs standards? We will call the ADL variants 
	as ADL package.

	Registering town, city and country names as well as names bearing 
	pure religious meanings could not be registered as Arabic Domain 
	Names. At the same time the system should not allow registering 
	names having meanings that contradict the culture of the people of 
	the Arabic characters group of languages. The system must also 
	abandon registering linguistically non-correct names.

INTERNET DRAFT		IDN-REG-ADM-ACG-APU	 september, 8, 2004



   5.2. Activation and deactivation of an ADL:

	If any name of an ADL package is to be activated or deactivated 
	ALL names within the ADL package must be activated and deactivated 
	at the same time, the administration system must provide some 
	mechanism to insure this process.

   5.3. Deleting an ADL:
	All names in an ADL package must be deleted when any name in the 
	package is requested to be deleted.

   
6. Administration framework of Arabic Domain Names:

   The ADL Administration framework is responsible of affording a 
   mechanism that respects all the previous conditions of dealing with 
   an ADL.


7. Principles underlying these guidelines:

   The previous guidelines must be considered with all Arabic 
   characters group of languages. Registration systems for each 
   language could be separated so that every language has its own 
   registration systems. At the same time coordination between these 
   systems is required to prevent reserving some words that have the 
   same writing in more than one language but may have different 
   meaning in another language.
   
   This must not affect the integrity of the Internet, as users of 
   a certain national domain name must be able to use domain names of 
   an other nationality. This can be accomplished by giving each 
   nationality of those who use the same characters a special string 
   as a Nationality Identifier (or NID). This NID will help the ADL 
   resolving system to determine the parameters of the " ToAscii " 
   function (RFC 3490).


8. Registration of Arabic ADL:

   ALL the names contained in an ADL package must be reserved 
   automatically by the reservation system. This will prevent 
   registering ADLs that have the same meaning but written differently 
   by more than one person.

9. Versioning of the language character variant tables:

   It is recommended to use the last version of the UNICODE. Only 
   the following Unicode characters are accepted in Arabic domain 
   names (according to Arabic Language standards).

10. Technical Recommendations:

   10.1. The ADL solutions is like any other IDN subject of approved 
   RFCs that speaks about the technical details of the realization of 
   IDNs. A solution must be developed using the IDNA (RFC 3490). This 
   in our opinion is the proper way to keep the integrity of the 
   Internet. The solution has also to take the nameprep standard in 
   consideration. We have to notice that the nameprep standard denies 
   the use of the space in a IDNs, and have to note that such denial 
   is not convenient for the Arabic Languages. As mentioned above 
   using the space as a separator between words is not a negotiable 
   matter (from a lingual point of view), so any development of an ADL 
   solution must provide a reasonable answer that enables ADLs to 
   contain spaces otherwise the solution will not be compliant with 
   the Arabic language organizations recommendations in this field.
      
   10.2. The solution must handle the problem of variants that 
   results from the existence of space as a separator, this solution 
   can be achieved by ignoring the absence of space between words 
   where a word ends with a non joint letter. The treatment of those 
   variants must be considered when designing the registration system.
      
   10.3. Tashkeel must be ignored only by the registration system, 
   and the layer that provides the ToAscii function. This procedure 
   gives the user the ability to use Tashkeel without affecting the 
   functionality of the IDNA.
      
   10.4. The variants resulting from the misuse of hamza with or 
   without Alef and Yeh and incorrect use of Yeh, Heh and Teh Marbuta 
   have to be treated as separate cases.

12. Security Considerations:

   This memo relates to IETF process, not any particular technology.
   There are security considerations when adopting any technology, but
   there are no known issues of security with IETF Contribution rights
   policies.


13. IANA Considerations

   IANA is expected to create and maintain a registry of algorithm names
   to be used as "Algorithm Names" as defined in Section 2.3.  The
   initial value should be "HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT".  Algorithm names
   are text strings encoded using the syntax of a domain name.  There is
   no structure required other than names for different algorithms must
   be unique when compared as DNS names, i.e., comparison is case
   insensitive.  Note that the initial value mentioned above is not a
   domain name, and therefore need not be a registered name within the
   DNS.  New algorithms are assigned using the IETF Consensus policy
   defined in RFC 2434. The algorithm name HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT
   looks like a FQDN for historical reasons; future algorithm names are
   expected to be simple (i.e., single-component) names.
