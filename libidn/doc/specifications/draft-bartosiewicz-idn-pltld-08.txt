Abstract

   This document describes rules of Internationalized Domain Name (IDN)
   registration under .PL - county code top level domain name (ccTLD).
   All the rules are based on the idea that the Registry registers the
   ACE (ASCII Compatible Encoding) label version of the IDN instead of
   IDN's Unicode form.  This document also includes the list of accepted
   Unicode code points for IDN registration uder ".PL" ccTLD.

1. Introduction

   NASK is the .PL ccTLD registry with the liberal policy of the
   internationalized domain name registration.  The policy of IDN
   registration preasented in the following sections of this doument is
   simple to deploy and do not require any changes to the current
   Registry routines.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "SHALL", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED",
   and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14, RFC 2119 [10].

   Characters in the document are given as their Unicode code points on
   U+XXXX format (X is a hexadecimal digit).

   "Registry" in this document is equivalent to PL ccTLD Registry "NASK".

   "ACE label" and "ACE prefix" is defined in Section 2 of [4].

   "NAMEPREP" is defined in [1], "PUNYCODE", "ToUnicode" and "ToASCII"
   is defined on [3].

3. Main concepts

    The Policy of the IDN-registration under .PL is liberal and is based
    on the following concepts:

    - NASK accepts only the proper ACE labels  (according to [3], [8]
      and [9]) which begin with the "xn--" prefix and contain only ASCII
      characters,

    - the received string after the ToUnicode operation (according to
      Section  4.2 of [4] and Section 6.2 of [3]) applied to the ACE
      label MUST only include code points [5] from one of the following
      sets:

   - A combination of characters from different sets is not allowed.
   
   The following pictogram presents the processing of an IDN into an ACE
   form acceptable by NASK for registration.

4. The IDN influence on Registry

   Registry's IDN registration policy described in Section 1 has no
   influence on Registry activities especially on invocing, whois and
   registration process. The Registry does not provide sunrise period
   for IDN registrations.


4.1 The subject of the contract

   The subject of the contract between Registry and Registrant is the
   ACE version of the IDN domain name.
   Registry stores ACE version in the zone files, whois and other
   internal databases. Registy MUST NOT store the IDN version of
   the domain name.


4.2 Variant tables

   Registry does not implement variant tables and bundles (concept of
   variant tables and bundles is described in [6])

4.3 Influence on EPP implementation.

   There is no influence on EPP implementation [7].

4. The release dates

   a. September 11th, 2003 - the release of Polish characters
      registration under .PL.

   b. October 6th, 2003 - the release of German characters.

   c. October 20th, 2003 - the release of remaining characters
      from Latin-1 Supplement and Latin Extended-A scripts.
