1.3.5
-----

1.3.5 fixes several minor issues, including the gathering of tests when using
package notation, using the coverage plugin with multiprocessing, and several
others.  See the CHANGELOG for more details.

Also note that nose 1.x is in maintenance mode.  We will not be
looking to add any features, and you should seriously consider
looking at nose2 as the way forward.

If you're interested in the future of nose, please take a look at the
nose2 project on github (https://github.com/nose-devs/nose2) or pypi
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose2/0.5.0).
