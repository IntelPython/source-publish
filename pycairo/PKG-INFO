        Pycairo is a Python module providing bindings for the `cairo graphics library
        <https://cairographics.org/>`__.
        
        The Pycairo bindings are designed to match the cairo C API as closely as
        possible, and to deviate only in cases which are clearly better implemented in
        a more ‘Pythonic’ way.
        
        Features of the Pycairo bindings:
        
        * Provides an object oriented interface to cairo.
        * Queries the error status of objects and translates them to exceptions.
        * Provides a C API that can be used by other Python extensions.
        
        Pycairo depends on **cairo >= 1.12** and works with **Python 2.7+** as well as
        **Python 3.3+**. Pycairo, including this documentation, is licensed under the
        **LGPLv2.1** as well as the **MPLv1.1**.
        
        If Pycairo is not what you need, have a look at `cairocffi
        <https://cairocffi.readthedocs.io>`__, which is an API compatible package
        using `cffi <https://cffi.readthedocs.io/>`__ or `Qahirah
        <https://github.com/ldo/qahirah>`__, which is using `ctypes
        <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html>`__ and provides a more
        "pythonic" API with less focus on matching the cairo C API.
