Before Pycairo 1.13 most of the enum values defined here where only available
as constants on the module level. See :ref:`legacy_constants`.

.. currentmodule:: cairo

.. class:: Antialias

    Specifies the type of antialiasing to do when rendering text or shapes.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13

    .. attribute:: DEFAULT

        Use the default antialiasing for the subsystem and target device

    .. attribute:: NONE

        Use a bilevel alpha mask

    .. attribute:: GRAY

        Perform single-color antialiasing (using shades of gray for black text
        on a white background, for example).

    .. attribute:: SUBPIXEL

        Perform antialiasing by taking advantage of the order of subpixel
        elements on devices such as LCD panels.

    .. attribute:: FAST

        Hint that the backend should perform some antialiasing but prefer
        speed over quality.

    .. attribute:: GOOD

        The backend should balance quality against performance.

    .. attribute:: BEST

        Hint that the backend should render at the highest quality,
        sacrificing speed if necessary.


.. class:: Content

    These constants are used to describe the content that a :class:`Surface`
    will contain, whether color information, alpha information (translucence
    vs. opacity), or both.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13

    .. attribute:: COLOR

        The surface will hold color content only.

    .. attribute:: ALPHA

        The surface will hold alpha content only.

    .. attribute:: COLOR_ALPHA

        The surface will hold color and alpha content.


.. class:: Extend

    These constants are used to describe how :class:`Pattern` color/alpha will
    be determined for areas "outside" the pattern's natural area, (for
    example, outside the surface bounds or outside the gradient geometry).

    The default extend mode is :attr:`NONE` for :class:`SurfacePattern` and
    :attr:`PAD` for :class:`Gradient` patterns.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13

    .. attribute:: NONE

        pixels outside of the source pattern are fully transparent

    .. attribute:: REPEAT

        the pattern is tiled by repeating

    .. attribute:: REFLECT

        the pattern is tiled by reflecting at the edges (Implemented for
        surface patterns since 1.6)

    .. attribute:: PAD

        pixels outside of the pattern copy the closest pixel from the source
        (Since 1.2; but only implemented for surface patterns since 1.6)


.. class:: FillRule

    These constants are used to select how paths are filled. For both fill
    rules, whether or not a point is included in the fill is determined by
    taking a ray from that point to infinity and looking at intersections with
    the path. The ray can be in any direction, as long as it doesn't pass
    through the end point of a segment or have a tricky intersection such as
    intersecting tangent to the path. (Note that filling is not actually
    implemented in this way. This is just a description of the rule that is
    applied.)

    The default fill rule is :attr:`WINDING`.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13

    .. attribute:: WINDING

       If the path crosses the ray from left-to-right, counts +1. If the path
       crosses the ray from right to left, counts -1. (Left and right are
       determined from the perspective of looking along the ray from the
       starting point.) If the total count is non-zero, the point will be
       filled.

    .. attribute:: EVEN_ODD

       Counts the total number of intersections, without regard to the
       orientation of the contour. If the total number of intersections is
       odd, the point will be filled.


.. class:: Filter

    These constants are used to indicate what filtering should be applied when
    reading pixel values from patterns. See :meth:`Pattern.set_filter` for
    indicating the desired filter to be used with a particular pattern.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13

    .. attribute:: FAST

        A high-performance filter, with quality similar *FILTER_NEAREST*

    .. attribute:: GOOD

        A reasonable-performance filter, with quality similar to
        *FILTER_BILINEAR*

    .. attribute:: BEST

        The highest-quality available, performance may not be suitable for
        interactive use.

    .. attribute:: NEAREST

        Nearest-neighbor filtering

    .. attribute:: BILINEAR

        Linear interpolation in two dimensions

    .. attribute:: GAUSSIAN

        This filter value is currently unimplemented, and should not be used
        in current code.


.. class:: FontSlant

    These constants specify variants of a :class:`FontFace` based on their
    slant.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13

    .. attribute:: NORMAL

        Upright font style

    .. attribute:: ITALIC

        Italic font style

    .. attribute:: OBLIQUE

        Oblique font style


.. class:: FontWeight

    These constants specify variants of a :class:`FontFace` based on their
    weight.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13

    .. attribute:: NORMAL

        Normal font weight

    .. attribute:: BOLD

        Bold font weight


.. class:: Format

    These constants are used to identify the memory format of
    :class:`ImageSurface` data.

    New entries may be added in future versions.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13

    .. attribute:: INVALID

        no such format exists or is supported.

    .. attribute:: ARGB32

        each pixel is a 32-bit quantity, with alpha in the upper 8 bits, then
        red, then green, then blue. The 32-bit quantities are stored
        native-endian. Pre-multiplied alpha is used. (That is, 50% transparent
        red is 0x80800000, not 0x80ff0000.)

    .. attribute:: RGB24

        each pixel is a 32-bit quantity, with the upper 8 bits unused. Red,
        Green, and Blue are stored in the remaining 24 bits in that order.

    .. attribute:: A8

        each pixel is a 8-bit quantity holding an alpha value.

    .. attribute:: A1

        each pixel is a 1-bit quantity holding an alpha value. Pixels are
        packed together into 32-bit quantities. The ordering of the bits
        matches the endianess of the platform. On a big-endian machine, the
        first pixel is in the uppermost bit, on a little-endian machine the
        first pixel is in the least-significant bit.

    .. attribute:: RGB16_565

        each pixel is a 16-bit quantity with red in the upper 5 bits, then
        green in the middle 6 bits, and blue in the lower 5 bits.

    .. attribute:: RGB30

        like :data:`RGB24` but with 10bpc.


.. class:: HintMetrics

    These constants specify whether to hint font metrics; hinting font metrics
    means quantizing them so that they are integer values in device space.
    Doing this improves the consistency of letter and line spacing, however it
    also means that text will be laid out differently at different zoom
    factors.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13

    .. attribute:: DEFAULT

        Hint metrics in the default manner for the font backend and target
        device

    .. attribute:: OFF

        Do not hint font metrics

    .. attribute:: ON

        Hint font metrics


.. class:: HintStyle

    These constants specify the type of hinting to do on font outlines.
    Hinting is the process of fitting outlines to the pixel grid in order to
    improve the appearance of the result. Since hinting outlines involves
    distorting them, it also reduces the faithfulness to the original outline
    shapes. Not all of the outline hinting styles are supported by all font
    backends.

    New entries may be added in future versions.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13

    .. attribute:: DEFAULT

        Use the default hint style for font backend and target device

    .. attribute:: NONE

        Do not hint outlines

    .. attribute:: SLIGHT

        Hint outlines slightly to improve contrast while retaining good
        fidelity to the original shapes.

    .. attribute:: MEDIUM

        Hint outlines with medium strength giving a compromise between fidelity
        to the original shapes and contrast

    .. attribute:: FULL

        Hint outlines to maximize contrast


.. class:: LineCap

    These constants specify how to render the endpoints of the path when
    stroking.

    The default line cap style is :attr:`BUTT`

    .. versionadded:: 1.13

    .. attribute:: BUTT

        start(stop) the line exactly at the start(end) point

    .. attribute:: ROUND

        use a round ending, the center of the circle is the end point

    .. attribute:: SQUARE

        use squared ending, the center of the square is the end point


.. class:: LineJoin

    These constants specify how to render the junction of two lines when
    stroking.

    The default line join style is :attr:`MITER`

    .. versionadded:: 1.13

    .. attribute:: MITER

        use a sharp (angled) corner, see :meth:`Context.set_miter_limit`

    .. attribute:: ROUND

        use a rounded join, the center of the circle is the joint point

    .. attribute:: BEVEL

        use a cut-off join, the join is cut off at half the line width from
        the joint point


.. class:: Operator

    These constants are used to set the compositing operator for all cairo
    drawing operations.

    The default operator is :attr:`OVER`.

    The operators marked as *unbounded* modify their destination even outside
    of the mask layer (that is, their effect is not bound by the mask layer).
    However, their effect can still be limited by way of clipping.

    To keep things simple, the operator descriptions here document the
    behavior for when both source and destination are either fully transparent
    or fully opaque.  The actual implementation works for translucent layers
    too.

    For a more detailed explanation of the effects of each operator, including
    the mathematical definitions, see https://cairographics.org/operators.

    .. versionadded:: 1.13

    .. attribute:: IN

        draw source where there was destination content (unbounded)

    .. attribute:: OUT

        draw source where there was no destination content (unbounded)

    .. attribute:: ATOP

        draw source on top of destination content and only there

    .. attribute:: DEST

        ignore the source

    .. attribute:: DEST_OVER

        draw destination on top of source

    .. attribute:: DEST_IN

    .. attribute:: DEST_OUT

        leave destination only where there was no source content

    .. attribute:: DEST_ATOP

        leave destination on top of source content and only there (unbounded)

    .. attribute:: SATURATE

        like over, but assuming source and dest are disjoint geometries

    .. attribute:: MULTIPLY

        source and destination layers are multiplied. This causes the result
        to be at least as dark as the darker inputs.

    .. attribute:: SCREEN

        source and destination are complemented and multiplied. This causes
        the result to be at least as light as the lighter inputs.

    .. attribute:: OVERLAY

        multiplies or screens, depending on the lightness of the destination
        color.

    .. attribute:: DARKEN

        replaces the destination with the source if it is darker, otherwise
        keeps the source.

    .. attribute:: LIGHTEN

        replaces the destination with the source if it is lighter, otherwise
        keeps the source.

    .. attribute:: COLOR_DODGE

        brightens the destination color to reflect the source color.

    .. attribute:: COLOR_BURN

        darkens the destination color to reflect the source color.

    .. attribute:: HARD_LIGHT

        Multiplies or screens, dependent on source color.

    .. attribute:: SOFT_LIGHT

        Darkens or lightens, dependent on source color.

    .. attribute:: DIFFERENCE

        Takes the difference of the source and destination color.

    .. attribute:: EXCLUSION

        Produces an effect similar to difference, but with lower contrast.

    .. attribute:: HSL_HUE

        Creates a color with the hue of the source and the saturation and
        luminosity of the target.

    .. attribute:: HSL_SATURATION

        Creates a color with the saturation of the source and the hue and
        luminosity of the target. Painting with this mode onto a gray area
        produces no change.

    .. attribute:: HSL_COLOR

        Creates a color with the hue and saturation of the source and the
        luminosity of the target. This preserves the gray levels of the target
        and is useful for coloring monochrome images or tinting color images.

    .. attribute:: HSL_LUMINOSITY

        Creates a color with the luminosity of the source and the hue and
        saturation of the target. This produces an inverse effect to
        :attr:`HSL_COLOR`
