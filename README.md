Sources used in Intel Python with a license that requires publication: GPL, LGPL, MPL

Each of the subdirectories is a component in Intel Python that has a license
that requires publication of the sources. This includes GPL, LGPL, and MPL. We
are publishing the original sources including any patches. Each component has
its own license, so we do not provide a license for this repo. The repo is
tagged with the release of Intel Python that uses it.

If you need the sources for a component that is not included here, please
contact scripting@intel.com
