Subject: GNU Libtasn1 2.12 released
<#part sign=pgpmime>
GNU Libtasn1 is a standalone library written in C for manipulating ASN.1
objects including DER/BER encoding/decoding.  GNU Libtasn1 is used by
GnuTLS to handle X.509 structures and by GNU Shishi to handle Kerberos
V5 structures.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.12 (2012-03-19) [stable]
- Cleanup license headers.
- build: Update gnulib files.
- Corrected DER decoding issue (reported by Matthew Hall).
  Added self check to detect the problem, see tests/Test_overflow.c.
  This problem can lead to at least remotely triggered crashes, see
  further analysis on the libtasn1 mailing list.

Commercial support contracts for Libtasn1 are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult AB, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding Libtasn1
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.  See http://josefsson.org/ for more details.

For developers interested in improving code quality, we publish
Cyclomatic code complexity charts that help you find code that may
need review and improvements:
  https://www.gnu.org/software/libtasn1/cyclo/

Code coverage charts indicate parts of the source code that needs
to be tested better by the included self-tests:

Clang can analyse the source code for common problems, here is its
report for libtasn1:
